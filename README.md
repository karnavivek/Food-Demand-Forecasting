# BLINKTO* - Predicting Demand of a Food Delivery App [Forecasting]

### About Blinkto:
Blinkto-- is a Food Delivery Company, who wishes to get forecast of the Demand & Price Fluctutions of its various food items, for an internal study they have been wondering about!! They need Demand Forecast to plan number of delivery personels, & They need Price Forecast to help them infer the maximum amount of discounts they can give for a particular food item! (*Name of the company made-up to invoke user in story-telling, It is a pun using combining 'Blinkit' and 'Zepto')

In this fun Time Series Data Analysis, I have used several forecasting techniques like AR, ARIMA, RNN, LSTM models to predict food prices, orders of a Food Delivery App, We compared each one of them &amp; deduced which is working well &amp; why, go through "README.md" for more details :)

### Scope:
To Gain Insights on Forecasting the Demand generate to the app, later making decisions based on the analysis which benefits the organization, either Maximizing Profits (or) Minimizing Losses.

### Steps:
1) Collect Data using Webscraping using Beautiful Soup (or) Real Time Data Feeds from APIs or Company owned Databases etc. 
2) Converting the collected data into something that computers will understand (Data Wrangling, Data Transformation, Feature Engineering techniques etc)
3) Performing Data Analysis using the data to gain insights about the company and problem statement (This can generate more new problem statements)
4) Making the data Time Series fit for Forecasting models like ARIMA, LSTM etc
5) Perform STATIONARITY Test, PACF, ACF, Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test to gain insights on Time series data, later fixing them if required (Scaling, Order Differencing etc).
6) Make Models like ARIMA, LSTM, \& Hyperparameter Tune it to get the best possible results
7) Benchmark all the models \& Select the best model to achieve the scope of the project.
8) Making a Simple OOPS implementation (forecaster.py, class $TSForecaster$) for easy of use, to other stakeholders

### Future Work:
